# Owncast Product Definition

## Why

By defining the goals and target user bases we have something stable to guide decisions, features, conversations and keep clarity around what is being built.

While these definitions and lists should not be seen as exhaustive, in theory, once this is seen as "complete" there should be few, if any changes, as that would note a large change in direction and goals.
