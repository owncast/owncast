Owncast is going through a complete rewrite of the web app frontend.

Visit the [UIv2 milestone](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/18) on GitHub to see the individual tasks for this project.

- [Redesign project](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/18)
- [Proposed redesign Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/B6ICOn1J3dyYeoZM5kPM2A/Owncast---Review?node-id=643%3A17)
- [Currently defined colors](/story/owncast-style-guide-colors--page)
- [Owncast Frontend Chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat/group/frontend-dev)

## Why?

- Moving to a full React Component workflow allows the project to be more productive and build features faster.
- Share code between the web frontend UI and the existing admin.
- Address feedback from users.
- Better accessibility.
- Better mobile experience.
- Updated [design](https://www.figma.com/proto/B6ICOn1J3dyYeoZM5kPM2A/Owncast---Review?node-id=643%3A646&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=643%3A17&starting-point-node-id=643%3A44).
- Standardize styling across the project by using a single design language and style guide.
- Allows more people to contribute to the project if we use popular frameworks.

## What

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

## Contributing

1. Find a component that hasn't yet been worked on by looking through the [UIv2 milestone](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/18)
   and the sidebar of components to the left.
1. See if you can have an example of this functionality in action via the [Owncast Demo Server](https://watch.owncast.online) or [Owncast Nightly Build](https://nightly.owncast.online) so you know how it's supposed to work if it's interactive.
1. Visit the `Docs` tab to read any specific documentation that may have been written about how this component works.
1. Go to the `Canvas` tab of the component you selected and see if there's a Design attached to it.
1. If there is a design, then that's a starting point you can use to start building out the component.
1. If there isn't, then visit the [Owncast Demo Server](https://watch.owncast.online), the [Owncast Nightly Build](https://nightly.owncast.online), or the proposed [v2 design](https://www.figma.com/proto/B6ICOn1J3dyYeoZM5kPM2A/Owncast---Review?node-id=643%3A646&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=643%3A17&starting-point-node-id=643%3A44) for some ways to start.
1. If no design exists, then you can ask around the Owncast chat for help, for come up with your own ideas!
1. No designs are stuck in stone, and we're using this as an opportunity to level up the UI of Owncast, so all ideas are welcome.

## How?

This rewrite is a large project, but like anything else, breaking it into pieces and working on one thing at a time will eventually get us to the finish line.
And that's what this interface lets us do. On this page we see all the different components still needing to be worked on, and have a place to document the functionality of these pieces.

## What about the Admin?

The admin has always been a Next+React+Ant project, so the goal is to touch that as little as possible except where needed to share code and styles.

## What is this page?

This is called [_Storybook_](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components.
This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start
up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

For example a button may have a disabled state that requires a specific scenario to take place in real-world use,
but here we you can just toggle the state to verify things are working as expected.

This means [new components should have a corresponding story added](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story) to make it easier to maintain the project.
