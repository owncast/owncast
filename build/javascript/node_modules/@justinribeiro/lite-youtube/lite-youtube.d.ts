/**
 *
 * The shadowDom / Intersection Observer version of Paul's concept:
 * https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed
 *
 * A lightweight YouTube embed. Still should feel the same to the user, just
 * MUCH faster to initialize and paint.
 *
 * Thx to these as the inspiration
 *   https://storage.googleapis.com/amp-vs-non-amp/youtube-lazy.html
 *   https://autoplay-youtube-player.glitch.me/
 *
 * Once built it, I also found these (👍👍):
